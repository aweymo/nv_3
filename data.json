Men of their race  who present.a strange and curious type  to most Americans  may be seen now on the railroads of California. They are made conspicuous even at a distance by their turbans  and without this queer headgear they would appear on a closer inspection to be very different from other oriental or European immigrants. Up to the present time their entrance into the labor field has caused no excitement  and it is probable that there are very few of them in California. A gang here and there makes an impression on the traveler without being noticeable because of its size. But there is a population of 294 361 000 in India  an area of 1 766 642 square miles  as.against a population that is probably considerably less than 400 000 000 on an area of 1 632 420 square miles in China  and a population of 47 000 000 on an area of 147 655 square miles in Japan. It is obvious  therefore  that if the Hindus should take to emigrating there are enough of them to bring about a new development in our immigration problem. The idea of exclusion might be broadened so as to apply to all eastern Asiatics  and it is certain that a large labor invasion from any Asiatic country would produce just such an agitation as “resulted in the laws barring out the Chinese. ","Dynamic In-Degree":"\u003c[-1967673600000.0, 0]; [-1967068800000.0, 0]; [-1966464000000.0, 0]; [-1966377600000.0, 0]; [-1965772800000.0, 0]; [-1965168000000.0, 0]\u003e","Dynamic Degree":"\u003c[-1967673600000.0, 0]; [-1967068800000.0, 0]; [-1966464000000.0, 0]; [-1966377600000.0, 0]; [-1965772800000.0, 0]; [-1965168000000.0, 0]\u003e"},"color":"rgb(0,202,147)","size":9.0},{"label":"\"Filipino Freedom Asked\"","x":64.61222076416016,"y":-6.245297431945801,"id":"36","attributes":{"date":"\u003c[-1255910400000.0]\u003e","object location":"https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id\u003dmaplanguage036","creator":"The Sunday Oregonian","Modularity Class":"1","Inferred Class":"5","Degree":"1","Dynamic Out-Degree":"\u003c[-1257033600000.0, 0]; [-1256428800000.0, 0]; [-1255737600000.0, 0]; [-1255132800000.0, 0]\u003e","link":"object location","description":"Article describing complicated labor environment in Grays Harbor where Filipino workers offered to move away if the Philippines were granted independence.","industry":"Fishing","community":"Filipino","Timestamp":"\u003c[-1255910400000.0]\u003e","Out-Degree":"0","In-Degree":"1","location":"Montesano; Washington","text":"Montesano Organization  takes Stand to Prevent Outbreak on Harbor. | Wash.

It may possibly said that this cannot be the true figure. 29 immigration from  Ireland and been going on so Jong that here must be large numbers not Included under the foregoing headings. But: the Trish immigration prior to the great famine. was not large. Between 1820 and 1830 it amounted to only h0 724  and in the following decade to 307 381. So that if we make every allowance for those whose grandparents or  remoter ancestors were of Irish origin  and who therefore do not appear in. tho census as Irish  we need hardly add :at the outside  more than 41 000 000 to the total already given  which would thus be raised to 6 000 000. But from these must be deducted the Irish Protestants who  in tho present century at least  cannot be reckoned with the others politically  and they hardly number less: than 600.000. Thus the total Catholic Irish element in the states cannot exceed 6 600 000. In further confirmation of this estimate may be quoted a statement  made not very long since {In an Irish-American newspaper  that the total Catholic population In the states is about 10 000 000. Gut   10 000 000 are largely made up of immigrants from the Catholic counties of Europe and from French Canada and Mexico—the ‘mutual figures are given In the census—and these  in addition to a proportion of the Germans  which an hardly: be less than 2 600 000  must number some 4 000 000; thus leaving the Irish which does not differ greatly from the estimate already arrived a t. It may be added that the English immigration into the States has be on greatly on the Increase since 1870  and the explanation as to the exaggerated numbers of the Trish is due to their being principally massed in the great elites of the Northeast and tho neighboring middle states.","Dynamic In-Degree":"\u003c[-2329948800000.0, 0]; [-2329344000000.0, 0]; [-2328652800000.0, 0]; [-2328048000000.0, 0]\u003e","Dynamic Degree":"\u003c[-2329948800000.0, 0]; [-2329344000000.0, 0]; [-2328652800000.0, 0]; [-2328048000000.0, 0]\u003e"},"color":"rgb(174,161,255)","size":9.0},{"label":"\"A Paper on Immigration\"","x":210.2286376953125,"y":-113.0523910522461,"id":"108","attributes":{"date":"\u003c[-1728000000000.0]\u003e","object location":"https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id\u003dmaplanguage108","creator":"The Tacoma Rotary Club","Modularity Class":"6","Inferred Class":"1","Degree":"1","Dynamic Out-Degree":"\u003c[-1728777600000.0, 0]; [-1728172800000.0, 0]; [-1727481600000.0, 0]; [-1726876800000.0, 0]\u003e","link":"object location","description":"Anti-Immigration pamphlet published by the Tacoma Rotary Club.","community":"Italian","Timestamp":"\u003c[-1728000000000.0]\u003e","Out-Degree":"0","In-Degree":"1","location":"Tacoma; Washington","text":"many of the conditions surrounding the immigrant.

I Immigration continues as it has  there are only two possibilities: first  the development of a new race in America  a race neither American  nor Italian  nor Russian—but a composite race; or  second  the growth of separate racial groups within this country  and this means absolutely no assimilation. @ Do we want either of these? Our country has more laborers than it needs; we have agitation and unrest everywhere. Are we going to try some new remedy on this disease  or are we going to: its source and restrict immigration? .©several methods have been suggested. to restrict Immigration  the best of which are as follows: First  the exclusion of those unable to read and write This measure has three times passed both houses of Congress and been vetoed by the President. Second  the exclusion of unskilled laborers unaccompanied by wives or families. This would do away with the floating population and aid in assimilation. Third  increase in the head tax. Canada has done this in the case of the Chinese. It now amounts to 500 and is very effective. Fourth  the material  increase in the amount of money required to be in possession of the immigrant at the port of entry. Fifth  the Imitation of the number of each race arriving each year to a certain percentage of the average of that race arriving during a given period of years. It is this last method that the Tacoma Rotary Club favors. It will put down the Immigration from Southern Europe and Is absolutely fair to every nation.

PAGAN MYSTICISM THE CAUSE. Love of Fighting Is the Curse of Japanese  Says Dr. Albert 8. Ashmead. Mikado Only a Figurehead Who Tokyo God Ia the Popular Mind  While the “Sat-cho ’” or War Party  Dr. Albert 8. Ashmead of New York and late foreign medical director of the Tokyo hospital in Japan  wrote as follows under a recent date to the editor of the New York Herald: ‘In your article in the Herald  entitled ‘Japan Prepares For War With the United States ’ in your quotation of and remarks from the Head de Paris concerning Mr. Nakahashi Tokugoro’s allusions in the Revue des Deux Mondes of Japan to the ‘Empire of the Mikado’ you have overlooked a very important point  which is always considered by the Japanese mind In Its ratiocinations. “The empire of the mikado to a Japanese means spiritual empire and not \u0026 mere material or temporal empire. For many centuries  while the mikados (heavenly gates) were isolated in their holy seclusion behind the Devil’s gate at Kyoto  there reigned mere temporal rulers  the shoguns (great generals) at Tokyo. In 1867  the beginning of the Meiji era  the Sat-cho (Satsuma and Choshin provincials of high degree)  a political ring  overthrew the shoguns and brought the figurehead of the empire from his sacred isolation at Kyoto. “He is the religious head of the nation  typifying the Bushido (war spirit) of the people  that is all. He Is not emperor—a word the Japanese do not know  although they use it to deceive westerners. A mikado is Tenno (son of heaven or God). He never dies  but hodzurus (translates). He is God in man’s form and as such can only reign in the spirit of the ration. ‘The real temporal ruler of the empire of Japan is that Sat-cho  a political clique  and the mikado {s only puppet king. His mentality is of a very low order. In fact  all the high nobles of Japan under the old order of nobility were rather effeminate of not really imbecile. The mikado is no exception to this category. Therefore he is easily handled politically by the ringmasters  whose only aim is to satisfy Samourisu  or Bushido  the war spirit of the nation  handed down to them from the time of Krishna  god of war  of Brahmanism  even at the beginning of protestant Buddhism. “This Is the curse of the Japanese people—that love of fighting—and be sides  there Is the worship of heroes. And how are heroes to be made in a Japanese point of view save by war? Samurais before the disestablishment of feudalism In 1867 was satiated by wars between the Damion. Each province or high class family’s servants (samurai) would fight with the next ones. But in 1867 samurai were nationalized into a central army  or fighting force. “This spirit of war  the true soul of Japan  will never be willing to remain in barracks for any length of time. It soon demands a new war. Where will a war be found to appease it by that ring of political tricksters called Satcho except In a foreign war? Thus ft will be ever. “After they have fought America they must find some other country to make war upon  That next In all probability will be Holland  for Japan must have the Dutch West Indies. And so it will go on. “Rut what [I write this letter for especially is to point out that the ‘spiritual empire’ of that pagan ‘ruler’ Is what we have most to dread. It Is that which threatens us already In our Pacific states. Paganism of the mika. do is already getting a foothold upon our Christian European and American shores. This is what we must guard against most. 4The war that is on in the world to day is that between two civilizations— paganism and Christianity. Until Jap Japanese have been taught by defeat that their emperor  as we call him  Is not a god or holy avatar there will be end: less wars on the part of Japan. We must put down her unholy paganism and then there will be peace of Chris Christianity. Which will win  paganism o! Christianity; the god of war (Krishna  or peace and good will to mer (Christ) ?”’","Dynamic In-Degree":"\u003c[-1967673600000.0, 0]; [-1967068800000.0, 0]; [-1966464000000.0, 0]; [-1966377600000.0, 0]; [-1965772800000.0, 0]; [-1965168000000.0, 0]\u003e","Dynamic Degree":"\u003c[-1967673600000.0, 0]; [-1967068800000.0, 0]; [-1966464000000.0, 0]; [-1966377600000.0, 0]; [-1965772800000.0, 0]; [-1965168000000.0, 0]\u003e"},"color":"rgb(68,216,0)","size":9.0},{"label":"\"Man Crushed To Death By Elevator\"","x":-38.12328338623047,"y":-196.18072509765625,"id":"142","attributes":{"date":"\u003c[-1964304000000.0]\u003e","object location":"https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id\u003dmaplanguage142","creator":"The Seattle Daily Times","Modularity Class":"3","Inferred Class":"2","Degree":"1","Dynamic Out-Degree":"\u003c[-1965254400000.0, 0]; [-1964649600000.0, 0]; [-1963958400000.0, 0]; [-1963353600000.0, 0]\u003e","link":"object location","description":"Lethal accident involving a Norwegian lumber worker.","industry":"Lumber","community":"Norwegian","Timestamp":"\u003c[-1964304000000.0]\u003e","Out-Degree":"0","In-Degree":"1","location":"Ballard; Washington","text":"MAN IS CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ELEVATOR Norwegian Laborer Meets F¥rightful .

The capacity of the Italian immigrant for rapid improvement is shown in the Argentine Republic  where climate and social conditions have favored his development  and where he has attained the first rank in the industries of the country. Italians own nearly half the commercial firms in Buenos Ayres  with n capital of $160 000 000  and more than half its workshops  Italian  architects have built the greater part of Buenos Ayres; Italians have all the river carrying trade and two-thirds of the coating trade: Italian peasants and men of business own nearly all the corn farms. The production of corn and artificial grasses has been created by the Italians  who own rural property lo the value of $60 000 000  and one jin every eight is a proprietor. The bulk of the engineering and milling .the paper and soap industries  almost all the hat and tobacco manufactures  most of the cement and marble works  a large part of the tanning and (tinned meat business this in the hands of Italians.

A Piedmont proprietor plants 67 000 acres in wheat; an Italian firm mows 12 000 acres of temporary grasses: an Italian  the foremost wine producer of South America  has 2600 acres under vines. The Italian vine growers of Mendoza and San Juan and Buenos Ayres produce every year 38 000 000 gallons of wine  All this has been done by uneducated  poverty stricken -Italian peasants in a few years. The Italian Immigrants who have performed this ‘mighty work in Argentina are identical) In quality and capacity with the Italian immigrants that were formerly condemned in the United States as useless or dangerous The popular prejudice against Italian immigration rests chiefly up a confusion of a genuine Italian peasant immigration with the comparatively(  worthless  homicidal  mongrel!  so-called Italian immigration from Sicily and Naples. Sicily had been ruled in succession by Greeks  Italians  Moors  Spaniards and Frenchmen: Calabria and Naples have muah of this mongrel  . The difference in quality between these Italian mongrels of Sicily and the extreme south of Italy and the fine peasantry that people Middle and Northern Italy is shown by the fact that while Northern Italy shows no ‘larger per cent of homicides than tho moat civilized countries of environs  Southern Italy shows a very high ave ago for homicide. The highest average for homicide is found among the poor  brutalized miners of Sicily  who are absolutely illiterate  Popular education has almost eliminated   to the Ticino  the Italian canton of Switzerland  where sixty years ago homicides were frequent and ignorance abounded.

He could have taken the government to task for the niggardly manner in which it has treated this reservation while on other reservations  and notably in the state of Oregon  immense sums are spent every year to keep the buildings and grounds in the best of condition. _ But the federal government has promised to mend its ways by appropriating a sum of $20 000 or $30 000 from the general fund as a starter towards putting the fast decaying buildings into better shape. The sum named will not go far; but it is a starter and will probably be followed by other appropriations until. finally the Puyallup reservation school will occupy the place that it is justly entitled to hold. Establishment of the School The first Indian school in Washington. was established on Squaxson Island in 1857. This school was started under the provisions of a treaty made with the Indians of Western Washington in 1854  whereby the United States government: agreed to maintain schools for a period of twenty years on the reservations. In 1873 a new building was erected the Puyallup reservation. The building was of logs and it stood near the banks of the river. At that time the school! attendance numbered. but eleven pupils. In 1873 a new building was erected better if each one toiled for himself instead of for the general good of a\u0027l. The attendance at school gradually increased until 1875 when the roll showed forty-five young Indian pupils. But the twenty years for which the government had agreed to maintain the schools expired and in June  1875  the school was closed and all employee were discharged. School Again Opened Up. The. Indian schools were not destined vo remain closed for any great length of time. Influences were at work that goon caused the schools to be opened again.and on July 15  1875  Rev. M. G.

The exclusion of the rank and file of the Chinese immigrants caused a scarcity of unskilled and skilled Oriental laborers that soon became apparent in all parts of the United States. caused the wage scale  which up to this time had been ridiculously low  to soar skyward  with the result that at the present time it is next to impossible to secure @ good Chinese servant at any price within reason. like his white brother  John was quick to take advantage of a “short market” and put his prices up accordingly. \u003cAs a servant it a family he is supreme  and is eagerly sought after by hotel and restaurant keepers as a cook. There after  properly speaking  five classes of Chinese—the “Coolie ” the servant  the farmer  the laundryman and the up-to-date Chinese business Taman. Of the coolie class there are few ‘that are employed now in the large cities  the larger portion within the confines Of the United States being employed in the canneries of Alaska. Here he is at his best as a skilled laborer  Going practically all of the work of the cannery. The Alaska canneries are largely at the mercy of the Chinese tabor contractors. as all of the work of preparing the fish for the cans is done by coolie help. They are more skilled than any machinery yet invented  and as fast as human bell can be. The fishing is done by the   Indians  but ‘ the actual preparing cf the salmon {is left to the expert   of John  . . \u003e As a farmer  either on a large or trail scale  there is no race on earth that equals the China boy. He is a born gardener and with a little coaching and experience soon develops into an orchard Or staple products baron. The Pacific coast  and particularly the southern part of California  {s to a great extent dependent upon the the-. forts and successes of her “excluded”. Chinese. And the lessons taught by the humble and heathen-John are peculiarly progressive and modern  the that they apply as much to the business operation of the farm \u0026s to the art Of securing \u0026 heavy yield to a small] acreage  Take the Chinese. company farms around Seattle  for instance    the common Chinese laborer has as much opportunity to become an independent farmer and ultimately a capitalist as have his brothers before him.who have started and prospered in the same man-.  . This system of the Chinese companies attracts by its very simplicity  which makes it attractive to the simpleminded field hand. Another notable feature of the come company farming system  which the Chinese have brought to such a flower of perfection  is the accounting end of the business  Every Chinese camp shack  no matter how dilapidated i¢ may look to the Caucasian visitor  has a set of firm books that are kept with an accuracy and wealth of detail} that would shame the average large American farmer  ‘kept with a brush pencil)  and working like a decorated Oriental piece Of bric a brac  the book of records misses nothing. and for very wealth of detail excels the usual bank cash transaction book. - oy. ~~ + [a Then  too  the follower of Confucius has another side that makes him.a Jiving wonder to all who come in contact with him.

JZ Mr.   can succeed in lining up the people of Oregon for this matter of emergency labor Importation he will have accomplished something that ‘will make his friends  his enemies and ‘himself grateful that he did not succeed in hits efforts for the Gubernatorial nomination. In order that American labor shall! not be adversely affected  such importation of Chinese should be   . directed by the United States Department of Labor and with such restrictions as will prevent their employment in any line where they would come into competition with white labor extent in food production work. In this state the greatest field for this currency labor tis in the clearing and development of land. There are tens of thousands of acres of land within the state from which the timber has been burned or removed  or in unused portions of our farms  that without such help as the Chinese can supply us will never be cleared  for at the present cost of white labor this land  even at the present high prices of products  will not   enough to pay interested the cost of clearing. With a lessened demand for labor following the war and the return of our boys from Europe  the problem of uncleared land will still be unsolved. Farm products will decrease to price {f wares are lowered and certainly no American wants to see our returned men put at such work at the wages that work will stand  If  however  the Chinese are kept busy while our men are in Europe in preparing land that will be available for use on their return  what will be the result? For every Chinaman kept on land clearing work for three years there will be an area prepared that will keep an American family  to supply whose wants roads and phone lines will be demanded  lumber for houses  furniture  clothing and agricultural implements will have to be supplied and a demand he created for hundreds of well-paid American workers at a time when useful work of some kind must be ready for several million released men. To prevent exploitation and expectations  regulations covering the sale of land could be made and agreed to buy  land owners before the Government allowed the use of Chinese for clearing. For farm work  where there would necessarily be some competition with white labor  the Chinese could be let ta the: farmers at an agreed price  the difference between the contract price between the Government and the Chinese and that between the Government and the farmers being the profit of the Government in the transaction. These profits should care for all the expenses incurred in the {importation and the of the Chinese to their homes when their term of service was over. One hundred thousand Chinese workers in Western Oregon on and clearing and reforesting for a term of three years at far better wages than they could possibly earn at home would certainly be of the greatest benefit to the state. AS many more as are necessary in food production work would guarantee an abundance for ourselves and our allies. What valid objection can be   to their employment? CG.

IJInaccuracies were numbers and egregious in Oregon and Washington  and were demonstrated so to be by supplementary enumerations. Such supplementary work was done elsewhere  and the truth may be that the amendments made brought the census out nearly correct. The showing of the proportion of those Who had been here before  among {immigrants  however  is significant. By a recent investigation  extending over the records back to July  1893  it was found that out of 2484 Bohemian immigrants 150 had been in this country before. Out of 38 711 German immigrants  30536 had been jin this country before. Out of 9992 English  19 686 Irish and 2342 scotch immigrants  7440 had been residents of this country in previous years  and out of 42.074 Italian immigrants  S111 were returning to the United States. Meanwhile the falling off In the aggregate Of immigration  noticed since 1892  continues unabated. For the final year ending June 380  1892. the total number of Immigrants arriving in this country from all sources was 666 663. In the next fiscal year  ending June fl)  1893  the number fell to 428 652  and in the next twelve months  ending June 30  1894  275 764 immigrants  . rived. In the nine fiscal months which have passed since  140 080 have reached this: Country  and if the same portion is maintained during the remaining three months of the fiscal year. even With the usual increase in April  May and J June  less than 200.000 immigrants will have arrived In this country during the twelve months ending J June \"0. 1895. It is noteworthy that the financial Cine pressure does not serve to account at least for this decrease  especially when it is considered that the hard times have been general the   as well as Chis country  and when a comparison is made with the falling off occasioned by previous panics. Thus the immigration for the financial year ending J June 30. 18:4  fell off only 26 per cent below that for the previous twelve months  and for the next succeeding twelve month only 38 per cent; while the immigration. for each fiscal year since 1892 has Shown a steady fall of 80 per percent at least  and sometimes more.

In Alabama for two years ending November 30  1910. the courts disposed of 630 homicide cases and imposed only 27 death sentences.
